/**
 * A low-level service to programmatically &quot;connect&quot; (or create a
 * session, or interact with; choose your term) the the framework's runtime.
 *
 * <p>
 *     This service is used internally by the framework itself, for example
 *     when a viewer receives a request a new {@link InteractionLayer} is created
 *     for the duration of the users's interaction.  It is also used by integration
 *     tests, to be able to connect to the database.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     You could think of this as analogous to an <code>HttpRequest</code>, or
 *     a JPA <code>EntityManager</code> or JDO <code>PersistenceManager</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     There are two main APIs exposed.  One is to
 *     {@link #openInteraction(InteractionContext) open} a new {@link InteractionLayer},
 *     to be {@link #closeInteractionLayers() closed later}.  The other is to
 *     execute a {@link Callable} or {@link ThrowingRunnable runnable} within the
 *     duration of an {@link InteractionLayer}, wrapping up automatically.
 *     This is what is used by {@link org.apache.isis.applib.services.sudo.SudoService}, for example.
 * </p>
